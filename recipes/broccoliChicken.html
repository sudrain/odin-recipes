    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken divan is a classic chicken casserole that layers leftover chicken with cream soup, butter, breadcrumbs, and cheese. This recipe adds broccoli to the mix, lending beautiful color and garden-fresh flavor to every bite.</p>
    <p>Divan takes the name of the Divan Parisien Restaurant, where the dish was created in the early twentieth century.</p>
